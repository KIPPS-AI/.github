# Kipps.AI: True North Star

Why We're Building [Kipps.AI](https://www.kipps.ai):

Kipps.AI is a platform to build an AI agent designed to optimise time spent on marketing, sales, and customer support for small businesses. Our mission is to help businesses efficiently handle these critical functions, allowing them to focus more on growth and less on repetitive tasks.

üòá Why We Love Our Customer
Small (team-size) business owners are some of the most passionate and hardworking individuals you'll meet. They wear multiple hats, juggling numerous responsibilities to keep their businesses running. Our goal is to alleviate some of this burden by streamlining marketing campaigns, automating sales processes, and enhancing customer support with AI. This allows them to focus on what they do best: growing their business and serving their customers.

üèóÔ∏è What We're Building
Kipps.ai is an all-in-one AI assistant that integrates seamlessly into existing workflows.

We have started with the most adapted AI application, the chatbot, to improve inbound marketing, sales, and customer support for businesses with small teams. Kipps chatbots have smart lead generation based on user persona identification. From conversations, Kipps identifies whether the user is a prospective buyer, a knowledge seeker, a job aspirant, a prospective investor, or a competitor.

Kipps chatbots do not rely on immediate human intervention, understanding that smaller teams might not be available immediately. However, we'd like to escalate concerns to the right channel with the user's contact information and intent.

Kipps.AI focuses on highlighting training data gaps back to the business (wherever the chatbot is not confident enough to help the user). Kipps also helps companies in generating the missing data. This approach minimizes the human support required.

We are thrilled to embark on this journey and invite you to join us in revolutionizing how small businesses operate.

With enthusiasm,
The Kipps.ai Team
